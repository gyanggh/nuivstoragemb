# Notes

- V1 will be missing
    - Feed
    - Upload
    - Still need to write translations
- Permament problems
    - A bit Janky, especially ui wise
    - Not the prettiest
    - No Transcoding (which means no thumbnails for one)
    - No redeploy
    - Fragile and hard to maintain: more a proof of concept than anything
    - User list (dealbreaker? Can be added just may take a while)
    - Good Search (similarily; though it's very "easy" to add later?)
    - Untested
- Notes
    - AWS has piss poor docs and too much customization; things take way too long
    - Should be good enough for a tech demo
- Expect
    - V2 with Feed upload translations
    - Documentation of all things
        - API endpoints (english)
        - Current code (also english)
